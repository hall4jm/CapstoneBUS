# Introduction
The aim of this project was to utilize current state-of-the-art CNN architectures for use in a pilot study to examine the use of the algorithms to aid in the classification of breast cancer in breast ultrasounds (BUS) images. The training script included allows for an easy way using fastAI to train and test multiple models.

The script also performs hyperparameter tuning using Tree-structured Parzen Estimator with hyperparameters that can be set in the configuration file passed to the Python script.

The python scripts can be run from the Python console or a Jupyter notebook. 

## Example 

The model and hyperparameter tuning options are stored in a JSON file and passed to the Python console along with the training script.
